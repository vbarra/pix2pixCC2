This explains how the files named fileListYYYY.txt are generated.
The files are generated on the hpc2 server where the sdo dataset
is available to us. We connect to the server via ssh. It depends
on your ssh config how the server is called. Here it is "hpc2".

The following example creates the file fileList2013.txt in your 
home directory on the server:

ssh hpc2   
cd /storage/databanks/machinelearning/NASA-Solar-Dynamics-Observatory-Atmospheric-Imaging-Assembly/
cd 2013/
find . -type f > ~/fileList2013.txt
